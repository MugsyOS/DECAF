## DECAF

DECAF is Mugsy's primary REST API. It handles all the non-hardware related functionality like users, recipes, integrations and tons more. DECAF also manages the brewing process through communications with Operator.

DECAF works with Mugsy's local SQLite database, using [Better-SQLite-3](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3), and [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview) for a comfy dev experience.
